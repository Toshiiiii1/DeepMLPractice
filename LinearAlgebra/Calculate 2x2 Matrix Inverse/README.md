## [Calculate 2x2 Matrix Inverse](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/8) ![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a Python function that calculates the inverse of a 2x2 matrix. The inverse of a matrix A is another matrix A⁻¹ such that A × A⁻¹ = I (the identity matrix).

For a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]], the inverse exists only if the determinant (ad - bc) is non-zero.

Return None if the matrix is not invertible (i.e., when the determinant equals zero).

### Example:

**Input:**

```python
matrix = [[4, 7], [2, 6]]
```


**Output:**

```bash
[[0.6, -0.7], [-0.2, 0.4]]
```
